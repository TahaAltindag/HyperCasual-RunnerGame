# PanteonDemo
This is the Hyper casual platform runner game I made for Panteon games.

Unity Version: 2020.3.21f LTS

How to play?
  You can do Swerving with "A" and "D" keys. 
  You can paint the wall at the end with left mouse click.
  You can change the aspect ratio in the menu. So you can play either Portrait or Landscape mode.
  
  You can find the playable Windows build in WindowsBuilds file.
